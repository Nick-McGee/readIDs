This is my first PHP project. It was made on Jan. 18, 2020 for BCHacks. A picture is taken of both the front and back of a UBCO student card, which are then anaylyzed using Google's Cloud-Vision API, and outputs an array of strings with relevant info. 

Note that the user requires a working API Key generated on the Google Cloud Console for this script to work.
